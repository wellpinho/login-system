Security Considerations

Store Passwords Securely: Never store passwords in plain text. Always use secure hashing like bcrypt.

Validate User Input: Make sure to validate user input to prevent injection attacks.

Brute Force Protection: Implement measures to protect against brute force attacks, such as limiting the number of login attempts.

JWT Security Settings: Keep the secret key safe and use short-lived tokens.

This is a basic example. For production, you should use a real database, implement more robust checks, and consider other additional security measures.
